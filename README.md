### What problem does this technology solve?
* Customers find relevant products
* Publishers curate better content
* Digital asset managers organize media
* Doctors make better diagnoses
* Determine if an image contains sensitive content
* Tons of possibilities

### How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?
No, however their documentation is very easy and provides everything you need

### What I built
I built a node application that uses image recognition with the clarifai api to determine what storefront is in the photo.
